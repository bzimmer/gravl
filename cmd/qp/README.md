# qp &mdash; copy activities from Strava to CyclingAnalytics

This is an example of a small command-line application demonstrating how to build functionality
not in the full `gravl` application.

Of interest is the use of the gravl configuration file `gravl.yaml` and the associated auth
flags for Strava and CyclingAnalytics but the rest of the application uses the standard client
functionality available in the `pkg` package.
